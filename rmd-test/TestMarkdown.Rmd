#Introduction
This is an R Markdown document. I created it in RStudio using Rmarkdown, knitr and shiny. It is hosted on my website.

#The Interactive Bit
In the section below you can select a dataset and the plot will change automatically. I will add more functions once I get a chance to sit down and think about what else I might want to do.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(datasets)
library(ggplot2)
library(shiny)
shinyApp(
  
  ui = fluidPage(
    selectInput("Dataset", "Choose a Dataset", 
                choices = list("Pressure" = 1,
                               "Orange Trees" = 2)),
    plotOutput("Dataplot"),
    htmlOutput("Explanation")
  ),
  
  server = function(input, output) {
    
    output$Dataplot = renderPlot({
      if (input$Dataset == 1) {
        ggplot(pressure, aes(x = temperature, y = pressure)) + 
          geom_point()
      }else{
        ggplot(Orange, aes(x = age, y = circumference, group = factor(Tree), colour = factor(Tree),
                        linetype = factor(Tree))) + 
          geom_line()
      }
    })
    
    output$Explanation = renderUI({
      if (input$Dataset == 1) { 
        p("You have selected the pressure dataset and the graph shows how the vapour pressure of Mercury changes with temperature. More information can be found ",
        a("here", target = "_blank", href = "https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/pressure.html"))
      }else{
        p("You have selected the orange trees dataset and the graph shows the growth rate of five orange trees. More information can be found ",
        a("here", target = "_blank", href = "https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/datasets/html/Orange.html"))
      }
    })
  },
  
  options = list(height = 600)
)
```
