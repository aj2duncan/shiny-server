```{r}
# load the graph data from source file
# note that in this case the graph is available in the sigmaNet package too
graph = read_graph("lesmis.gml", format = "gml")
```

The graph in this case is network of when Les Miserables characters appear together. (D. E. Knuth, *The Stanford GraphBase: A Platform for Combinatorial Computing*, Addison-Wesley, Reading, MA (1993)) and is available for download [here](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mejn/netdata/).
