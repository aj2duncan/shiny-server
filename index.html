	<h1>Welcome to my Shiny Server</h1>
<!--		<p>So far I don't have very much on here but I have taken some apps from the <a href="httpss://github.com/ShinyEd/ShinyEd" target="_blank">ShinyEd</a> git repository which I plan to edit to suit my purposes. These include:
            <ul>
                <li> <a href="https://r.aj2duncan.com/shiny/CLT_mean/">Investigating</a> the central limit theorem for means.
                </li>
                <li> <a href="https://r.aj2duncan.com/shiny/CLT_prop/">Investigating</a> the central limit theorem for proportions.
                </li>
                <li> A correlation <a href="https://r.aj2duncan.com/shiny/correlation_game/">game</a>. 
                </li>
                <li> A distribution <a href="https://r.aj2duncan.com/shiny/dist_calc/">calculator</a>. 
                </li>
                <li> Simple linear regression <a href="https://r.aj2duncan.com/shiny/slr_diag/">diagnostics</a>. 
                </li>
            </ul>
		</p>
        <p>I also have the starting point of my own Rmarkdown <a href="https://r.aj2duncan.com/shiny/rmd-test/">document</a>.</p>
-->
  <p>So far I don't have much on here (at least not much I want to show everyone anyway!). Each of the courses below has a number of apps that are associated with them.</p>
  <h2>Risk and Introduction to Modelling</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Examine the <a href="https://r.aj2duncan.com/shiny/risk/lotka-volterra/">Lotka-volterra</a> system of equations to model predator-prey populations.
    </li>
    <li>
      Examine some simple <a href="https://r.aj2duncan.com/shiny/risk/disease/">disease</a> models. See how some straight forward changes can make a big difference to the spread of the diease.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Higher Statistics Unit</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Is correlation thing only thing you need to judge the fit of linear regression? Have a look at this <a href="https://r.aj2duncan.com/shiny/stats/correlation/">app</a> and see what you think. (modified from <a href="httpss://stat.duke.edu/%7Emc301/shinyed/">Shiny Ed</a>)
    </li>
    <li> 
      <a href="https://r.aj2duncan.com/shiny/stats/dist_calc/">This</a> is a distribution calculator (modified from <a href="httpss://stat.duke.edu/%7Emc301/shinyed/">Shiny Ed</a>) that allows you to conduct hypothesis testing amongst other things.
    </li>
    <li>Can you <a href="https://r.aj2duncan.com/shiny/stats/guess_the_correlation/">guess the correlation</a> (modified from <a href="httpss://stat.duke.edu/%7Emc301/shinyed/">Shiny Ed</a>) in a quick game to help identify the value of the correlation coefficient from some random data.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Higher Mathematics</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Investigate recurrence relations and their limits in <a href = "https://r.aj2duncan.com/shiny/higher/rec_rel/">this</a> Shiny app.
    </li>
  </ul>
